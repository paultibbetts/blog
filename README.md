# blog

My blog built on [Ã®les](https://github.com/ElMassimo/iles).

I'm in the middle of deciding what I want to do with it - for now it's just a landing page.

I'll be blogging at [micro.blog](https://paultibbetts.micro.blog) in the meantime.

## Project Setup

```sh
bun install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development
